# What is Priiloader #

[Priiloader](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Preloader/Priiloader) is [a modded version of Preloader 0.30](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Preloader) by [DacoTaco](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/User:DacoTaco) and BadUncle.
our aim is to get Preloader 100% bugfree and make it as safe/functional as possible.

**quick note: priiloader will _NOT_ save your wii if you fucked up the system menu ios (on 4.2 this is ios70. see [here](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/IOS_History) to check which ios that is for you.**
# What has been changed since Preloader 0.30 base source? #

  * added Bootmii IOS booting option to menu and autoboot (handy for restoring and/or sneek)
  * Support for all HBC title Id's
  * removed need for ES\_DIVerify

  * re-added online updating
  * added our own installer (phpgeek's)

# What do i need to install Priiloader? #

thats the best part! all you need is a way of booting homebrew (Homebrew channel recommended). if you have The homebrew channel 1.0.7 or above, you dont need any patched ios's at all! if you dont, then a patched ios36 is required.

priiloader itself needs no hacked ios at all (hell, we recommend using unpatched ios's)
